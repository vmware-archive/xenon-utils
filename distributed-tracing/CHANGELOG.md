# CHANGELOG

## 0.0.3-SNAPSHOT

* Overhaul and update to OpenTracing rather than Brave v2 libraries. This is a major API incompatible break but should
  be unlikely to happen in future, as OpenTracing has passed 1.0 in its API and is very much looking for long term
  stability to enhance adoption.
  
* Added support for Zipkin V2 API servers in addition to V1 servers.

* Added support for Jaeger reporting.

## 0.0.2


## 0.0.1

* Initial release
