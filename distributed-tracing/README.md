# distributed-tracing

This module provided a third-party integration of [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io/)with Xenon. That integration is now a core
feature in Xenon-common, part of the new [OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io/) integration. There is still a demo
ServiceHost here to demonstrate working with OpenTracing.

# Configuration and installation

See the Xenon-Common README.md documentation.
